Dear %%first_name%%,

Students who struggle to read can quickly fall behind grade level and remain at risk. We want to partner with you to give your students every opportunity to succeed with LANGUAGE!® Live, our proven intervention program that helps struggling readers move toward new levels of literacy success.

You can experience LANGUAGE! Live in your district with the new LANGUAGE! Live Literacy Acceleration Grant, designed to help educators increase literacy rates in underperforming students.
The LANGUAGE! Live Literacy Acceleration Grant makes it possible to effect dramatic changes in literacy achievement without additional budget expense.
